# Winterthur Design System

Welcome to the Winterthur Styleguide! This repository was setup to help align the NetCommunity pages with the rest of the current Winterthur brand, but with a few other things in mind.

This code base is intended to mock what currently exists for RaisersEdge and Wordpress, but also aims to scale the styles better for an eventual change. It also attempts to make style updates and additions easier.

There are 3 main sections below that detail everything you'll need to know.

## Technical Documentation (Code)

| Audience         | Requirements                                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Technical people | Working knowledge of HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and NPM |

This section of the documentation reviews how the styles have been setup and how they be edited, utilized, and scaled for future development. This section (at some points) will get pretty deep in talking about architecture, styles, and then deployments, so if you want to limit the scope of your focus, I would suggest reading onto the next section.

## Functional Documentation (NetCommunity)

| Audience      | Requirements                                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Page Creators | Working knowledge of basic NetCommunity parts |

This section is going to review anything that has to do with **implementing** what has been created in the technical section inside of the NetCommunity system. This section is for anybody who is actually going to be creating the pages and using the NetCommunity system for page creation. It differs in the sense that you won't be **_developing_** the pieces needed, but instead, you'll be **_implementing_** the pieces

## Styleguide

This isn't a section by more of an easy point to get to the interactive styleguide.
