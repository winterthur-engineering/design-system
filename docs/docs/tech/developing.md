# Development environment

The development environment is created using a library called [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). This is a reactive development environment that allows engineers to code small bits of code in isolation. It also has a few nice features one of them being automatic reload once any changes are saved.

Anytime a style change or HTML change is made, storybook will automatically reload itself and you'll see changes automatically reflected in the UI.

You can create different stories that load markup and the existing styles that you create.

Read the [storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-html/#step-4-write-your-stories) if you have any questions on creating stories.

You can also check out [this video]() that walks through the entire development environment including writing new stories.
