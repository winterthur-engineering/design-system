- Level 1 - BASE PARTS
  **Creating a new base part in NetCommunity**
  - base parts are shared across all templates. Changing them once will change them in every place. So if you create a new page, and you decide to edit the base part, every page will be updated with those changes so make sure. This will help you with maintenance as that if you want to make navigation changes you can do that on a global level instead of having to edit each page on it's own.
  - base parts a fundamental parts of every webpage. Headers, footers, brands, etc... Think of them as components that no matter what kind of content you have ont the page, they will always exist in it. (headers, footers, nav-bars, brands, etc...)
  - base parts should always have the box checked
