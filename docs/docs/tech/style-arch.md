# Style Architecture

This section will break out the `src/styles` directory into detail and run through how to create, maintain, and test the styles that you have created.

This section assumes you have some working knowledge of how Sass works. If you don't, I suggest checking out their documentation. [Sass - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Directory Organization

```
ðŸ“¦styles
 â”£ ðŸ“‚bootstrap
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚class-overrides
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚custom-styles
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚variable-overrides

```

This directory is broken out into 2 specific sub-directories and then subsequently broken up into a few other smaller directories to separate concerns.

### `styles/bootstrap`

This contains any Bootstrap specific augmentations or overrides.

Since Bootstrap is the basis for both RaisersEdge and the Wordpress site, it made sense to base the style framework on it. There are 3 sub-directories that break up concerns. Check out the table below to see how the style sheets should be interfaced.

| Priority order | Directory                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Tutorial                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1              | `bootstrap/variable-overrides` | The base part of interfacing bootstrap styles. This is where Bootstrap defaults and Sass variables should be imported and then overridden.                                                                                                                                       | [Changing bootstrap defaults](./overriding-bootstrap.md) |
| 2              | `bootstrap/class-overrides`    | The styles in this directory are direct overrides of the classes that are generated by bootstrap.                                                                                                                                                                                | [Overriding bootstrap classes](./extending-bootstrap.md) |
| 3              | `bootstrap/custom-styles`      | This is the highest level in our bootstrap overrides where you can create custom classes out of bootstrap classes. The classes that are written in this stylesheet do not originate from any bootstrap styles but can extend the existing bootstrap classes to make new classes. | [Writing new classes](./create-new-styles.md)            |

### `styles/netcommunity`

The styles in this directory are dedicated to overriding Net Community default styles. Any parts that are used, i.e. Donation, Membership, etc... have a default classes that can be exported from the system, and then overridden.
