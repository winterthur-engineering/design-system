**Part Organization**

Try to keep the folders as flat as possible... so in other words, don't create sub-folders. Doing this enforces a few good practices:

1. Keeping them flat forces you to follow the proper naming conventions
2. Decreases the complexity of where things are located... So you don't run into the instance of "oh crap, where did I put that part". You know... the times when you put something in it's "extra special" place thinking you're going to remember it, but when you go to get it, you actually realize that "extra special" place was like sock drawer or something.
